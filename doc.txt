prototype n functions:
int	mlx_pixel_put(void *mlx_ptr, void *win_ptr, int x, int y, int color);
void	*mlx_new_window(void *mlx_ptr,int size_x,int size_y,char *title);

int	encode_rgb(uint8_t red, uint8_t green, uint8_t blue)
{
	return (red << 16 | green << 8 | blue);
}


Bases:
x, y. it is considered that the top left corner of the screen is the origin (x = 0, y = 0).

Let's consider a common screen resolution, that is 1920x1080.
x = colonnes, y = ligne (nbr pixel)
In this case, that means that there's 1080 rows of pixels on the screen, and that
each row has 1920 pixels. The y axis is used to represent the row number, while
the x axis is used to represent the column number.

int handle_keypress(int keysm, t_data *data)
int render(t_data *data)
